## **About Us**

**Penetration Testing & Cybersecurity Portfolio**

With a foundation in computer science and a passion for cybersecurity, I have dedicated my career to the critical field of penetration testing. From an early age, I immersed myself in the world of technology, exploring the intricacies of network security, protocols, and ethical hacking. I believe in the power of cybersecurity to protect organizations and make a meaningful impact in the world.

Now, as part of **Cosmic Industries**, I bring my expertise to a broader scope of services, integrating my penetration testing skills with Cosmic Industries’ mission to offer secure and high-quality solutions for military and civilian clients alike. My goal remains constant: to use my skills to help secure networks, systems, and applications against potential threats, offering services that are both comprehensive and adaptive to the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
