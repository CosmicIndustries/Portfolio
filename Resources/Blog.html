                Introduction:
                <br>
                &nbsp;During testing of [Redacted until enacted]'s trial demo website, I discovered a potential
                vulnerability in the [Redacted] feature. By changing the max-limit input length, I was able to create
                more [Redacted] than I should have been able to.
                <br>
                <br>
                Description of Vulnerability:
                <br>
                &nbsp;The vulnerability is a result of inadequate input validation on the server-side of the
                application.
                This allows users to exceed the predetermined max-limit for the input length, potentially leading to
                unintended consequences such as consuming excessive system resources or causing errors in the
                application.
                <br>
                <br>
                Impact:
                <br>
                &nbsp;While the impact of this vulnerability may
                vary depending on the specific implementation of the application, it is important to address this issue
                to ensure the security and integrity of the system.
                <br>
                <br>
                Resolution:
                <br>
                &nbsp;To fix this issue, I recommend implementing strict input validation on the server-side to ensure
                that
                the max-limit input length cannot be exceeded. This can be achieved by adding validation checks to
                ensure that the length of the input does not exceed the predetermined max-limit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Conclusion:
                <br>
                &nbsp;I hope that this writeup has provided a clear understanding of the input validation vulnerability
                on
                [Redacted until enacted]'s trial demo website and the steps that can be taken to resolve it. It is
                important to regularly test and maintain the security of web applications to protect against potential
                vulnerabilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;I would like to thank [Redacted until enacted] for their prompt attention to this matter and for
                their efforts to ensure the security of their systems.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sincerely,
                <br>
