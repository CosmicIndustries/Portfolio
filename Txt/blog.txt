Title: "Disclosure of Input Validation Vulnerability on [Redacted until enacted]'s Trial Demo Website"

Introduction:

During testing of [Redacted until enacted]'s trial demo website, I discovered a potential vulnerability in the [Redacted] feature. By changing the max-limit input length, I was able to create more [Redacted] than I should have been able to.

Description of Vulnerability:

The vulnerability is a result of inadequate input validation on the server-side of the application. This allows users to exceed the predetermined max-limit for the input length, potentially leading to unintended consequences such as consuming excessive system resources or causing errors in the application.

Impact:

While the impact of this vulnerability may 
vary depending on the specific implementation of the application, it is important to address this issue to ensure the security and integrity of the system.

Resolution:

To fix this issue, I recommend implementing strict input validation on the server-side to ensure that the max-limit input length cannot be exceeded. This can be achieved by adding validation checks to ensure that the length of the input does not exceed the predetermined max-limit.

Conclusion:

I hope that this writeup has provided a clear understanding of the input validation vulnerability on [Redacted until enacted]'s trial demo website and the steps that can be taken to resolve it. It is important to regularly test and maintain the security of web applications to protect against potential vulnerabilities.

I would like to thank [Redacted until enacted] for their prompt attention to this matter and for their efforts to ensure the security of their systems.

Sincerely,
