            <li class="glitch"> &nbsp;Network Penetration Testing for a Small Business: As a Jr. Penetration Tester in
                training, I
                used Nmap and Metasploit to identify vulnerabilities in the small business's network infrastructure. I
                provided
                recommendations for improving security protocols and hardening the network against potential attacks.
            </li>
            <li class="glitch">
                &nbsp;Web Application Penetration Testing for a Non-Profit Organization: In this project, I used Burp
                Suite
                and sqlmap
                to identify vulnerabilities in the non-profit organization's web-based applications. I provided
                recommendations
                for improving security protocols and hardening the applications against potential attacks.
            <li class="glitch">&nbsp;Mobile Application Penetration Testing for a Financial Institution: In this
                project, I
                used
                tools such as MobSF and DroidBox to identify vulnerabilities in the financial institution's mobile
                applications.
                I provided recommendations for improving security protocols and hardening the applications against
                potential
                attacks.
            </li>
            <li class="glitch">
                &nbsp;Mobile Application Penetration Testing for a Local School District: In this project, I used MobSF
                and
                DroidBox
                to identify vulnerabilities in the school district's mobile applications. I provided recommendations for
                improving security protocols and hardening the applications against potential attacks.

            <li class="glitch">
                &nbsp;Vulnerability Assessment for a Small Retail Store: In this project, I used tools such as Nessus
                and
                OpenVAS to
                identify vulnerabilities in the retail store's network infrastructure and web-based applications. I
                provided
                recommendations for improving security protocols and hardening the systems against potential attacks.

            <li class="glitch">
                &nbsp;Red Team Assessment for a Local Government Agency: As part of a red team, I simulated a real-world
                cyberattack
                on the government agency's networks and systems. I used a variety of tools and techniques, including
                social
                engineering and physical access attacks, to identify vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for
                improvement.
