      <li>Web Application Penetration Testing for an E-Commerce Company: In this project, I used tools such as Burp Suite and sqlmap to identify vulnerabilities in the e-commerce company's web-based applications. I provided recommendations for improving security protocols and hardening the applications against potential attacks.</li>

      <li>Mobile Application Penetration Testing for a Financial Institution: In this project, I used tools such as MobSF and DroidBox to identify vulnerabilities in the financial institution's mobile applications. I provided recommendations for improving security protocols and hardening the applications against potential attacks.</li>

      <li>Red Team Assessment for a Government Agency: In this project, I worked as part of a red team to simulate a real-world cyberattack on the government agency's networks and systems. I used a variety of tools and techniques, including social engineering and physical access attacks, to identify vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for improvement.</li>

      <li>Vulnerability Assessment for a Manufacturing Company: In this project, I used tools such as Nessus and OpenVAS to identify vulnerabilities in the manufacturing company's network infrastructure and web-based applications. I provided recommendations for improving security protocols and hardening the systems against potential attacks.</li>
